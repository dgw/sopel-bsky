* Configurable replacement character for newlines in skeet text (#11, #12)

Fixed:

* Fix handling of skeet links using DID instead of handle (#10)

General:

* Updated `atproto` library version for Python 3.9+ (#6)

* Fixed parsing ISO-format timestamps without milliseconds
* Meta-updates (package metadata, workflows)

**Note:** This release doesn't support Python 3.14 (which became stable earlier
in October 2025), because `atproto` doesn't support it yet.

no longer cause exceptions.
